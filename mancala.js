// As users playing a two player game we want to:

// enter our names and have them displayed
// have our order chosen for us by the game
// take alternating turns according to the rules
// pick a pit that has pips and is ours on our turn
// have those pips distributed correctly according to the rules of mancala
// capture opponent pips when we end in an empty pit on our side
// take an extra turn when we end in our mancala
// be told when a player wins or if there is a draw once all pips are in mancalas
// start the game over without having to reset the browser
// As a user playing a one player game I want to:

// see the name 'Computer' displayed as my opponent
// have the Computer player make moves as if it were a human player, obeying all the rules from the two player game
// As a user playing a single player game I would be delighted if:

// the computer made 'better-than-guessing' choices when choosing a pit for the next move
