// As users playing a two player game we want to:

// enter our names and have them displayed
// have our order chosen for us by the game
// take turns by dropping our chip into a column on the grid
// not be able to drop a chip into a totally filled column
// be told when a move causes a player to win, or to draw
// start the game over without having to reset the browser
// As a user playing a single player game I additionally want to:

// see the name 'Computer' displayed as my opponent
// have the Computer player choose columns as if it were a human player
// As a user playing a single player game I would be delighted if:

// // the Computer chooses the correct column for a win, when possible
